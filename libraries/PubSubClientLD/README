This is a tweaked version of the PubSubClient library used for the LaserDisplay, with two changes:
* MQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE increased from 128 to 512 to accomate the larger JSON formatted messages
* MQTT_KEEPALIVE split into MQTT_KEEPALIVE_SEND and MQTT_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT - the first being the
  time sent to broker on connect as the Keep Alive time interval, the second being how often we
  will send pings (in the absense of other messages).
  This is to work around the problem of millis() not incrementing inside interrupt handlers, and
  the broker disconnecting us when we don't send anything for longer than the keepealive period.
